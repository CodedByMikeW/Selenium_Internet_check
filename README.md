# Selenium_Internet_check
This Python project uses Selenium to automatically check internet speed through Speedtest.net. When the script runs, it launches a Chrome browser, clicks the "Go" button, waits for the test to finish, and then scrapes the download and upload speeds. It prints the results directly to the consoleâ€”no user interaction needed.
